# StoreSalesAnalysis


Data Analysis Project: Grocery Sales
This is a python project used to draw conclusions about how these stores are performing. I answered the following five questions with visualization.

Q1: Which store has the highest total sales for the final month of data?
Q2: Which store makes the most sales on average?
Q3: Which store sells the most during the week of March 13th, 2016?
Q4: In what week does store C make its worst sales?
Q5: Which store has the most sales in the latest 3-month period?
